# 1. Goal
AI should be easier. As many state-of-the-art models in every domain comes out in a fast pace, a good default one might be able to solve a wide range of tasks. My goal in this repository is to create good baseline models that are up-to-date with SOTA, and useful without much coding from scratch. The only thing left to do is to prepare the data as well as possible and do some hyperparameter tuning.

# 2. Development plan
- 1st: Retrieval using metric learning
